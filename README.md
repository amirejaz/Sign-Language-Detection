# Sign-Language-Detection
Implementing a real-time hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and machine learning for interaction with a computer.
Tools and Libraries:

OpenCV
cvzone (HandTrackingModule and ClassificationModule)
NumPy
Keras (for the pre-trained model)
Overview:
The project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and track a user's hand in real-time. The system is designed to recognize hand gestures through a pre-trained deep learning model, allowing users to interact with a computer using specific hand signs.

Implementation:

Hand Detection: Utilizes the HandTrackingModule from cvzone to identify and track the user's hand within the camera feed.

Gesture Classification: Implements a gesture classifier using a pre-trained deep learning model (keras_model.h5) and associated labels (labels.txt) from the ClassificationModule in cvzone.

Image Processing: Extracts the region of interest (ROI) around the hand, adjusts its size, and prepares it for classification. The aspect ratio of the hand's bounding box is considered for accurate resizing.

Gesture Recognition: Feeds the processed hand image into the classifier, predicting the corresponding gesture label. The recognized gesture is then overlaid on the camera feed, providing real-time feedback.

User Interaction:
Users can perform specific hand gestures, each associated with a distinct label (A, B, C, D, E). The system displays the recognized gesture on the screen in real-time, allowing for intuitive and hands-free interaction.

Usage:

Run the script, and the camera feed will display in real-time.
The hand gestures recognized are printed in the console.
